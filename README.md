# Learniom
## Description
Learning management system that helps an **Admin** to manage university,
where the Admin can:
- Add / delete -> Student, Professor, courses and other admins as well
- Search -> through all Student, Professor, courses
- Filter displayed data in Student, Professor, courses <br />
## Designing Stage
Before start codind our programm we design different **UML DIAGRAMS** to help visualizing work flow of the programm and the neccessary classes, so we have implemented:
- Use Case Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- Class Diagram
- Activity Diagram
here on of UMls diagram, Sequence Diagram that shows flow of the program

## Technology
We implemented this project using **c++** programming language and **QT framework** to design responisve UI. <br/>
And we chose this language because of its speed compilation process comparing to other programming languages like python or java, as we needed our porject to deal with the big data in an efficient way.
